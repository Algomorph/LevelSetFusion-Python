SobolevFusion / KillingFusion 2D Simulation / Testing Code

Experiment runnable scripts are located in the experiment folder. All code continously tested **except** code in the experiment folder.

## 2019-08-02 Announcement

The development on this codebase is suspended as I switch back (temporarily) to work on dynamic-scene fusion experiments in the [Algomorph/InfiniTAM](https://github.com/Algomorph/InfiniTAM) repository (which are much further along at this point in terms of results).
